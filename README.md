## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations**:

- This is a demonstration interface designed for local development/testing
- Data is stored in browser localStorage (not secure for production)
- For production use, implement:
  - Proper encryption for password storage
  - Secure backend authentication
  - HTTPS connections
  - Regular security audits

## IMAP Email Reading

The email reader interface demonstrates how IMAP email reading would work. Due to browser security restrictions (CORS), direct IMAP connections from browsers are not possible. For full functionality, you would need:

1. A backend server (Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Server-side IMAP connection handling
3. API endpoints to serve email data to the frontend
4. Proper authentication and security measures

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Local storage support required for data persistence

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Navigate through the interface
3. Use demo features to explore functionality
4. Consider implementing backend services for production use

## Future Enhancements

- Server-side IMAP implementation
- Enhanced security features
- Database integration
- Multi-user support
- Advanced email analysis
- Password strength validation
- Two-factor authentication support
